## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

First of all, I am a Computer Science student. 
I currently work as a Backend developer at Maaxdo Technologies. I've also worked as a freelance developer for the past 3 years.

I am interested in building software solutions that tackle real-world problems and learning more about programming concepts.
Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a lot of things ðŸ‘€
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with anybody for any project I find interesting
- ðŸ’¬ More about me ... <a href="">Portfolio</a>
- âš¡ Fun fact: Nothing is fun anymore, LOL
